<p><strong>Pace Services</strong></p>
<ol class="number-list">
<blockquote>
<p><u>Sale and Purchase of the Right to Receive Payment</u></p>
</blockquote>
<li>
<p>We provide services (<strong>Pace Services</strong>) that enables
a Customer Member to pay for Pace Buys from a Merchant Member by three
interest-free instalments. A Customer Member shall make all instalment
payments using the Payment Method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a Customer Member makes a Pace Buy:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha-bracket-list">
<li>
<p>The Merchant Member, as the sole legal and beneficial owner of
the Right to Receive Payment, agrees to irrevocably and unconditionally
sell and assign the Right to Receive Payment to us immediately after the
Pace Buy is concluded between the Merchant Member and the Customer
Member and the Customer Member consents to such sale and
assignment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, the Right to Receive Payment is
assigned to us immediately after a Pace Buy is concluded. In exchange,
we shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to pay the Merchant
Member the price of the Pace Buy within two (2) business days, less the
Merchant Fee and any amounts then owing by the Merchant Member to Pace
under this Agreement (including any amounts arising from a Reversal
transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, we reserve the
right to defer the settlement date until such other time that the
cumulative amounts to be settled to the Merchant Member exceed the sum
of KRW100,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have the sole discretion to accept or reject the assignment to
the Right to Receive Payment including for reasons relating to fraud or
any other risks which we determine may be associated with the
transaction . If we decline the assignment, the Pace Platform shall
reject such transaction and a Pace Buy will not be able to be completed.
In the event of such rejection, the Merchant Member and the Customer
Member shall make their own arrangement in relation to the completion of
the sale and purchase of the goods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Merchant Member shall authorize Pace to send a notification
on behalf of the Merchant Member to the Customer Member’s email address,
as provided in the Customer Member’s Registration Data. This
notification shall serve as a notice by the Merchant Member to notify
the Customer Member that the Right to Receive Payment is assigned to us
and shall also contain instructions to the Customer Member regarding the
method of payment to us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Customer Member pays us, as the sole legal and beneficial
owner of the Right to Receive Payment in place of the Merchant Member,
the price of the Pace Buy in three instalments in accordance with the
schedule displayed on the payment page for the relevant Pace Buy on the
Pace Platform. The first instalment is due and payable upon the Pace
Buy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except as provided in this clause, the rights and obligations of
the Customer Member and the Merchant Member in relation to the sale and
purchase under the Pace Buy remain unchanged.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Merchant Member pays the Merchant Fee for the use of Pace
Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Customer Member is not required to pay us any fees for the use
of Pace Services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pace Services are not loans, financing or credit facilities of
any kind whatsoever. We do not provide insurance of any kind. We are
solely a factoring technology service provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each Merchant Member is solely and fully liable for the sale and
supply of goods and services under a Pace Buy. We are not a party to the
sale and purchase contracts under Pace Buys. We do not own, create,
manufacture, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver or
supply any Merchant Member goods or service. We expressly disclaim all
warranties related to the Merchant Member goods and services, express,
implied or howsoever arising, including any warranties of accuracy,
reliability, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
non-infringement.</p>
</li>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Early Payment by Customer Member</u></p>
</blockquote>
<li>
<p>A Customer Member can make an early payment of any instalment(s)
owing to us, whether partially or in full, at any time before the due
date of the relevant instalment(s) (<strong>Early Payment</strong>). No
fees or charges are imposed on a Customer Member for making an Early
Payment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Customer Member will need to manually input in the Pace
Platform the amount of Early Payment that is desired to be made for the
relevant Pace Buy transaction. We will apply the entire Early Payment
amount made against the upcoming instalment which will become due and if
there is any surplus payment in excess of the upcoming instalment amount
due, such surplus amount will be applied against the following
instalment that is yet to be due.</p>
</li>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Reversal Transaction</u></p>
</blockquote>
<li>
<p>Each Merchant Member is solely and fully liable for handling
disputes, refunds, returns and all other aspects of the sale and supply
of goods and services in connection with a Pace Buy. For the avoidance
of doubt, we will not be responsible to any Customer Members for any
defects or failure in delivery of the goods and services by the Merchant
Member. We will refer all Customer Members to the relevant Merchant
Member for these purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the event that we receive a Reversal Instruction from a
Merchant Member in respect of any order by a Customer Member, we shall
process the Reversal transaction, as follows:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha-bracket-list">
<li>
<p>Within two (2) business days of sending to Pace a Reversal
Instruction, a Merchant Member shall refund Pace the relevant amount and
such refund shall be effected by Pace’s deduction from the running
balance to be settled with the Merchant Member. In the event that the
running balance is insufficient, the Merchant Member shall refund Pace
the relevant amount by telegraphic bank transfer to Pace’s nominated
bank account upon demand;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right to retain the applicable Merchant Fee in
respect of the relevant Pace Buy in the event of any Reversal
transaction;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Following our receipt of the Reversal Instruction from the
Merchant Member, we shall activate the refund to a Customer Member as
soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ten (10) business days. A
Customer Member’s refund shall be effected in the following order:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman-bracket-list">
<li>
<p>We shall first set off the amount to be refunded against the
value of all instalments that have yet to fall due for payment;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thereafter, if there remains any balance amount to be refunded,
the sum shall be refunded to the Payment Method, subject to any terms
and policies which may be imposed by the debit or credit card providers,
payment processors and financial institutions providing or related to
the Payment Method. Depending on the policies instituted by the Customer
Member’s debit or credit card providers, the Customer Member can expect
to receive the refund within around seven to fourteen (14) business days
from the time that Pace activates the refund.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Merchant Member shall strictly comply with the process
described in this Clause 3.11 in respect of any Reversal transaction. A
Merchant Member must not provide any refunds directly to a Customer
Member, failing which, Pace reserves the right to clawback such monies
that were made to the Merchant Member in respect of the Pace Buy
transaction.</p>
</li>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Cancellation</u></p>
</blockquote>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other terms to the contrary in these Terms, we
reserve the right to cancel any Pace Buy transaction where we become
aware that a Service Failure on the part of a Merchant Member has
occurred. We shall not effect a cancellation if, within two (2) business
days of our written notification, a Merchant Member is able to produce
supporting evidence in the form of documents, invoices or any other
records to our reasonable satisfaction showing that the Service Failure
raised by the Customer Member is untrue or inaccurate.</p>
</li>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Merchant Limit</u></p>
</blockquote>
<li>
<p>A Merchant Member shall be subject to the Merchant Limit which
shall be determined by us from time to time in our sole discretion. For
clarity, we reserve the right to modify a Merchant Member’s Merchant
Limit at any time by written notification, and the revised Merchant
Limit shall take effect immediately upon service of such
notice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We reserve the right (but not the obligation) to suspend any
further Pace Buys from being transacted through the Merchant Member’s
Account if the Merchant Limit is or will be exceeded.</p>
</li>
<blockquote>
<p><u>Tax</u></p>
</blockquote>
<li>
<p>If the sale and purchase of the Right to Receive Payment is subject
to any value added tax (<strong>VAT</strong>) imposed under law, the
Merchant Member agrees that the Merchant Fee shall be subject to the
imposition of VAT.</p>

<p><strong>Chargeback</strong></p>
<ol class="number-list">
<li>
<p>A Merchant Member and a Customer Member shall render their
fullest cooperation to do all things we deem necessary for the
investigation of any Chargeback initiated by a Customer Member with the
card issuer, payment processor or card network against any of the Pace
Buy instalments due to us. Without prejudice to the generality of the
foregoing, a Merchant Member and Customer Member shall comply with the
following process (<strong>Chargeback Evaluation Process</strong>):</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha-bracket-list">
<li>
<p>We shall notify the Merchant Member and Customer Member as soon
as reasonably practicable when we become aware of a Chargeback
(<strong>Chargeback Notification</strong>). We shall also convey to the
Merchant Member the reasons provided by the Customer Member, the card
issuer, payment processor and/or card network for the
Chargeback.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Merchant Member shall furnish to us sufficient evidence, in
the form of any relevant supporting information and/or documents
(<strong>Supporting Evidence</strong>), to enable the card issuer,
payment processor or card network to evaluate the veracity and
legitimacy of the Chargeback within two (2) days of the Chargeback
Notification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Merchant Member may be required to provide additional
Supporting Evidence if required by the card issuer, payment processor or
card network, and the Merchant Member shall comply with such request(s)
within the timeline stipulated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We shall notify the Merchant Member as soon as reasonably
practicable upon receiving the determination by the card issuer, payment
processor or card network on the Customer Member’s dispute on the
Chargeback (<strong>Chargeback Decision</strong>). The Chargeback
Decision shall be final and binding on the Merchant Member and Customer
Member and shall not be subject to any appeal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Notwithstanding any other terms to the contrary, failure to
comply with any part of the Chargeback Evaluation Process may, in our
sole discretion, render a Merchant Member liable to us for the amount
corresponding to the Chargeback transaction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Merchant Member shall accept responsibility for a Chargeback
Decision attributable to the Merchant Member’s breach of the terms and
conditions in connection with its sale of goods and services to a
Customer Member, including for reasons due to (a) the failure to deliver
goods and services, (b) provision of goods that are defective, damaged
or fail to conform to the described specifications, and (c) provision of
inadequate or defective service. Consequently, the Merchant Member shall
be liable to us for the amount corresponding to the Chargeback
transaction. Within two (2) business days of written notification of a
Chargeback Decision made against a Merchant Member, the Merchant Member
shall pay to Pace the relevant amount and such payment shall be effected
by Pace’s deduction from the running balance to be settled with the
Merchant Member. In the event that the running balance is insufficient,
the Merchant Member shall pay to Pace the relevant amount by telegraphic
bank transfer to Pace’s nominated bank account upon demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a Merchant Member is determined or deemed to be responsible
for a Chargeback pursuant to Clause 9, the Merchant Member shall also
indemnify us for any fines, fees or assessment charges imposed by the
payment processor, card network and/or card issuer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Customer Member shall accept responsibility for a Chargeback
Decision that is determined against the Customer Member and remain
liable to us for any outstanding instalments, as well as any payments
withheld and/or deducted from the card issuer, payment processor and/or
card network due to the Chargeback initiated by the Customer Member. If
a Chargeback Decision is determined against a Customer Member, the
Customer Member shall also indemnify us for any fines, fees or
assessment charges imposed by the payment processor, card network and/or
card issuer. All outstanding payments referred to under this Clause 9.4
shall be payable to Pace within seven (7) business days of written
notification of the Chargeback Decision.</p>
