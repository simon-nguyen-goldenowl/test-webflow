<p><u>Sale and Purchase of the Right to Receive Payment</u></p>
<ol class="DocumentContent__OrderedList-sc-3bh8oi-3 clOVzZ">
<li><p>We provide services (<b>Pace Services</b>) that enables a Customer Member to pay for Pace
Buys from a Merchant Member by three interest-free instalments.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When a Customer Member makes a Pace Buy:</p>
<ol class="DocumentContent__OrderedList-sc-3bh8oi-3 cMceue">
<li><p>The Merchant Member, as the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Right to Receive
Payment, agrees to irrevocably and unconditionally sell and assign the Right to
Receive Payment to us immediately after the Pace Buy is concluded between the
Merchant Member and the Customer Member and the Customer Member consents to such
sale and assignment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For the avoidance of doubt, the Right to Receive Payment is assigned to us
immediately after a Pace Buy is concluded. In exchange, we shall exercise
commercially reasonable efforts to pay the Merchant Member the price of the Pace
Buy, less the Merchant Fee and any amounts then owing by the Merchant Member to Pace
under this Agreement (including any amounts arising from a Reversal transaction)
through Channel Partner within the timelines stipulated by Channel Partner to the
Merchant Member.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We have the sole discretion to accept or reject the assignment to Right to Receive
Payment without providing any reason. In case of the rejection of assignment, the
Pace Platform shall reject such transaction and a Pace Buy will not be able to be
completed. In the event of such rejection, the Merchant Member and the Customer
Member shall make their own arrangement in relation to the completion of the sale
and purchase of the goods.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Merchant Member shall authorize Pace to send a notification on behalf of the
Merchant Member to the Customer Member’s email address, as provided in the Customer
Member’s Registration Data. This notification shall serve as a notice by the
Merchant Member to notify the Customer Member that the Right to Receive Payment is
assigned to us and shall also contain instructions to the Customer Member regarding
the method of payment to us.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Customer Member pays us, as the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Right to
Receive Payment in place of the Merchant Member, the price of the Pace Buy in three
monthly instalments. The first instalment is due and payable upon the Pace Buy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Except as provided in this clause, the rights and obligations of the Customer Member
and the Merchant Member in relation to the sale and purchase under the Pace Buy
remain unchanged.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>A Merchant Member pays the Merchant Fee for the use of Pace Services.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Pace Services are not loans, financing or credit facilities of any kind whatsoever. We do not
provide insurance of any kind. We are solely a technology service provider.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Each Merchant Member is solely and fully liable for the sale and supply of goods and services
under a Pace Buy. We are not a party to the sale and purchase contracts under Pace Buys. We
do not own, create, manufacture, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver or
supply any Merchant Member goods or service. We expressly disclaim all warranties related to
the Merchant Member goods and services, express, implied or howsoever arising, including any
warranties of accuracy, reliability, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and
non-infringement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br><u>Reversal Transaction</u></p>
<ol class="DocumentContent__OrderedList-sc-3bh8oi-3 clOVzZ">
<li><p>Each Merchant Member is solely and fully liable for handling disputes, refunds, returns and
all other aspects of the sale and supply of goods and services in connection with a Pace
Buy. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not be responsible to any Customer Members for any
defects or failure in delivery of the goods and services by the Merchant Member. We will
refer all Customer Members to the relevant Merchant Member for these purposes</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the event that we receive a Reversal Instruction from a Merchant Member through Channel
Partner in respect of any order by a Customer Member, we shall process the Reversal
transaction, as follows:</p>
<ol class="DocumentContent__OrderedList-sc-3bh8oi-3 cMceue">
<li><p>Upon receipt of the Reversal Instruction, Channel Partner shall reverse any payment
it made to Merchant Member by debiting the account balance of the Merchant Member’s
account with Channel Partner. If there are insufficient funds in the Merchant
Member’s account with Channel Partner, Merchant Member shall pay Channel Partner the
difference within the timeline stipulated by Channel Partner.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We reserve the right to retain the applicable Merchant Fee in respect of the relevant
Pace Buy in the event of any Reversal transaction.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Following our receipt of the Reversal Instruction, we shall activate the refund to a
Customer Member as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
</li>
<li><p>In the event that a Merchant Member fails to comply with its obligation under this
Clause or Channel Partner is unable to deduct the amounts arising from a Reversal
transaction from the amounts payable by Channel Partner to a Merchant Member, we
reserve the right to set off all such amounts owing from any other payments to be
made to a Merchant Member with respect to further Pace Buys.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br><u>Merchant Limit </u></p>
<ol class="DocumentContent__OrderedList-sc-3bh8oi-3 clOVzZ">
<li><p>A Merchant Member shall be subject to the Merchant Limit which shall be determined by us from
time to time in our sole discretion. For clarity, we reserve the right to modify a Merchant
Member’s Merchant Limit at any time by written notification, and the revised Merchant Limit
shall take effect immediately upon service of such notice.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We reserve the right (but not the obligation) to suspend any further Pace Buys from being
transacted through the Merchant Member’s Account if the Merchant Limit is or will be
exceeded.</p>

<p><b>Policy on Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism</b></p>
<ol class="DocumentContent__OrderedList-sc-3bh8oi-3 uyPNU">
<li><p>The purpose of this policy is to establish the general framework against money laundering
(<b>ML</b>) and financing of terrorism (<b>FT</b>).</p>
</li>
<li><p>We put reasonable measures in place to control and to limit ML and FT risk, including
dedicating the appropriate means.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We are committed to high standards of anti-money laundering and countering the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) compliance and requires management and employees to adhere to these
standards in preventing the use of its products and services for ML or FT purposes.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We take a broad view of the crimes that are related to money laundering, and specifically
includes tax evasion as a money laundering offence. Our policy on the AML and CFT applies to
all countries in which we operate and to all business activities within those countries</p>
</li>
<li><p>We will:</p>
<ol class="DocumentContent__OrderedList-sc-3bh8oi-3 cMceue">
<li><p>Establish clear lines of internal accountability, responsibility and reporting for
AML and CPT compliance. All business areas must ensure that appropriate internal
controls are in place and operating effectively, with regular reporting to the
Pace's senior management;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Document, implement and maintain procedures and controls for each business in the
context of local law and regulations. Compliance with these procedures and controls
are monitored;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Take all reasonable steps to verify the identity of merchants and customers, and
where appropriate, their beneficial owners. We will obtain additional
know-your-customer information according to a risk-based approach;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Establish procedures to retain adequate records of identification, account opening,
and transactions for the minimum period required under law. Records relating to
staff training, internal compliance monitoring, and suspicious activity reporting
will also be retained for the minimum period required under law;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Monitor ongoing user activity to keep records up to date and identify any activity
that may involve money laundering. This includes using automated systems to monitor
customer transactions and to identify higher-risk users;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Refuse and report any transaction where reasonable grounds exist to suspect ML or FT;
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make prompt reports of suspicious activity through the appropriate internal channels
and where required, to the relevant regulatory and law enforcement authorities;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Raise awareness of AML and CFT and train our staff how to recognise and report
suspicious activity; and</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cooperate with any lawful request for information made by government or law
enforcement agencies during their investigations into ML or FT.</p>
