3.  **Pace Services**

> [Sale and Purchase of the Right to Receive Payment]{.underline}

1.  We provide services (**Pace Services**) that enables a Customer
    Member to pay for Pace Buys from a Merchant Member by three
    interest-free monthly instalments. A Customer Member shall make all
    instalment payments using the Payment Method.

2.  When a Customer Member makes a Pace Buy:

    a.  The Merchant Member shall first ensure that the Merchant Limit
        has not and will not exceed the Merchant Limit as a result of
        the Pace Buy to be transacted by the Customer Member.

    b.  The Merchant Member, as the sole legal and beneficial owner of
        the Right to Receive Payment, agrees to irrevocably and
        unconditionally sell and assign the Right to Receive Payment to
        us immediately after the Pace Buy is concluded between the
        Merchant Member and the Customer Member and the Customer Member
        consents to such sale and assignment.

    c.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Right to Receive Payment is
        assigned to us immediately after a Pace Buy is concluded. In
        exchange, we shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to
        pay the Merchant Member the price of the Pace Buy within two
        business days, less the Merchant Fee, Transaction Fee, and any
        amounts then owing by the Merchant Member to Pace under this
        Agreement (including any amounts arising from a Reversal
        transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, we reserve
        the right to defer the settlement date until such other time
        that the cumulative amounts to be settled to the Merchant Member
        exceed the sum of S\$100.

    d.  We have the sole discretion to accept or reject the assignment
        to Right to Receive Payment without providing any reason. In
        case of the rejection of assignment, the Pace Platform shall
        reject such transaction and a Pace Buy will not be able to be
        completed. In the event of such rejection, the Merchant Member
        and the Customer Member shall make their own arrangement in
        relation to the completion of the sale and purchase of the
        goods. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not be a party to the
        transaction (in any capacity) once the Pace Platform has
        rejected such transaction. It is deemed that all assignments of
        the Right to Receive Payment are accepted by us if the
        underlying Pace Buy transaction is not rejected by the Pace
        Platform or was otherwise transacted in breach of this
        Agreement.

    e.  The Merchant Member shall authorize Pace to send a notification
        on behalf of the Merchant Member to the Customer Member's email
        address, as provided in the Customer Member's Registration Data.
        This notification shall serve as a notice by the Merchant Member
        to notify the Customer Member that the Right to Receive Payment
        is assigned to us and shall also contain instructions to the
        Customer Member regarding the method of payment to us.

    f.  The Customer Member pays us, as the sole legal and beneficial
        owner of the Right to Receive Payment in place of the Merchant
        Member, the price of the Pace Buy in three monthly instalments.
        The first instalment is due and payable upon the Pace Buy.

    g.  Except as provided in this clause, the rights and obligations of
        the Customer Member and the Merchant Member in relation to the
        sale and purchase under the Pace Buy remain unchanged.

3.  A Merchant Member pays the Merchant Fee and Transaction Fee for the
    use of Pace Services.

4.  A Customer Member is not required to pay us any fees for the use of
    Pace Services. A Merchant Member shall not charge a Customer Member
    any separate fees, costs, or charges on Pace Buys for any purposes
    whatsoever.

5.  Generally, a Customer Member is not permitted to make Pace Buys in
    excess of the Pace Buy Limit. The Pace Buy Limit is reduced by the
    total amount of a Customer Member\'s unpaid instalments. However, we
    may in our sole discretion permit a Customer Member to make Pace
    Buys in excess of the Pace Buy Limit provided that the amount paid
    by the Customer Member for the first instalment at the point of
    purchase is increased to the extent necessary to ensure that the
    remaining instalments payable is within the Pace Buy Limit. For the
    avoidance of doubt, unless excepted as provided in the foregoing
    sentence, we will not be a party to the transaction (in any
    capacity) in the event that the Customer Member has exceeded the
    Pace Buy Limit.

6.  Pace Services are not loans, financing or credit facilities of any
    kind whatsoever. We do not provide insurance of any kind. We are
    solely a technology service provider.

7.  Each Merchant Member is solely and fully liable for the sale and
    supply of goods and services under a Pace Buy. We are not a party to
    the sale and purchase contracts under Pace Buys. We do not own,
    create, manufacture, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer,
    deliver or supply any Merchant Member goods or service. We expressly
    disclaim all warranties related to the Merchant Member goods and
    services, express, implied or howsoever arising, including any
    warranties of accuracy, reliability, merchantability, fitness for a
    particular purpose and non-infringement.

> [Early Payment by Customer Member]{.underline}

8.  A Customer Member can make an early payment of any instalment(s)
    owing to us, whether partially or in full, at any time before the
    due date of the relevant instalment(s) (**Early Payment**). No fees
    or charges are imposed on a Customer Member for making an Early
    Payment.

9.  A Customer Member will need to manually input in the Pace Platform
    the amount of Early Payment that is desired to be made for the
    relevant Pace Buy transaction. We will apply the entire Early
    Payment amount made against the upcoming instalment which will
    become due (and late fees payable, if any) and if there is any
    surplus payment in excess of the upcoming instalment amount due,
    such surplus amount will be applied against the following instalment
    that is yet to be due.

> [Late Fee]{.underline}

10. A Customer Member shall pay all instalments promptly before the due
    date. We do not impose interest if you fail to pay all instalments
    on time. However, if the payment is not received by the due date, an
    initial late payment of S\$10 will be levied, and a further S\$1 per
    day if the payment remains unpaid after the due date. For each order
    below S\$40, a maximum of one S\$10 late fee may be applied per
    instalment payment. For each order of S\$40 or above, the late fees
    of each instalment payment that may be applied are capped at 25% of
    the original order value or S\$60, whichever is less. Subject to
    Clause 1.3 above, we reserve the right to alter the late fees in our
    sole discretion.

> [Reversal Transaction]{.underline}

11. Each Merchant Member is solely and fully liable for handling
    disputes, refunds, returns and all other aspects of the sale and
    supply of goods and services in connection with a Pace Buy. For the
    avoidance of doubt, we will not be responsible to any Customer
    Members for any defects or failure in delivery of the goods and
    services by the Merchant Member. We will refer all Customer Members
    to the relevant Merchant Member for these purposes.

12. In the event that we receive a Reversal Instruction from a Merchant
    Member in respect of any order by a Customer Member, we shall
    process the Reversal transaction, as follows:

    a.  Within two business days of sending to Pace a Reversal
        Instruction, a Merchant Member shall refund Pace by paying the
        relevant amount by telegraphic bank transfer to Pace's nominated
        bank account;

    b.  We reserve the right to retain the applicable Merchant Fee in
        respect of the relevant Pace Buy in the event of any Reversal
        transaction. In addition, if the Customer Member had failed to
        pay the relevant instalment by the due date, we also reserve the
        right to deduct the applicable late fees from the refund due to
        the Customer Member;

    c.  Following our receipt of the Reversal Instruction from the
        Merchant Member, we shall activate the refund to a Customer
        Member as soon as reasonably possible. A Customer Member's
        refund shall be effected in the following order:

        i.  We shall first set off the amount to be refunded against the
            value of all instalments that have yet to fall due for
            payment; and

        ii. Thereafter, if there remains any balance amount to be
            refunded, the sum shall be refunded to the Payment Method,
            subject to any terms and policies which may be imposed by
            the debit or credit card providers, payment processors and
            financial institutions providing or related to the Payment
            Method. Depending on the policies instituted by the Customer
            Member's debit or credit card providers, the Customer Member
            can expect to receive the refund within around seven to
            fourteen business days from the time that Pace activates the
            refund; and

    d.  In the event that a Merchant Member fails to comply with its
        obligation under this Clause 3.12 or Pace is unable to deduct
        the amounts arising from a Reversal transaction from the amounts
        payable by Pace to a Merchant Member, we reserve the right to
        set off all such amounts owing from any other payments to be
        made to a Merchant Member with respect to further Pace Buys.

> [Merchant Limit]{.underline}

13. A Merchant Member shall be subject to the Merchant Limit which shall
    be determined by us from time to time in our sole discretion. For
    clarity, we reserve the right to modify a Merchant Member's Merchant
    Limit at any time by written notification, and the revised Merchant
    Limit shall take effect immediately upon service of such notice.

14. We reserve the right (but not the obligation) to suspend any further
    Pace Buys from being transacted through the Merchant Member's
    Account if the Merchant Limit is or will be exceeded.

> [Tax]{.underline}

15. If the sale and purchase of the Right to Receive Payment is subject
    to any goods and services tax (**GST**) imposed under law, the
    Merchant Member agrees that the Merchant Fee and Transaction Fee
    shall be subject to the imposition of GST.

7.  **Account Suspension and Termination**

    1.  We may terminate or suspend an Account at any time and for any
        reason without your consent or prior notice to you. Without

        right to limit, suspend or terminate your Account:

        a.  if you are in breach of these Terms, including any of your
            eligibility warranties;

        b.  if you fail to pay any amounts or fees required under these
            Terms; or

        c.  if (i) it is subject to any Security Breach, or (ii) it is
            subject to actual or suspected fraud, illegality or uses
            inconsistent with the intended purposes of the Pace Platform
            and Pace Services.

    2.  At your request and subject to your payment of the prevailing
        administrative fee (if any), we may in our discretion reactivate
        a suspended or terminated Account.

    3.  You may terminate your Account at any time by sending us a
        termination notice at info@pacenow.co. We may require up to
        thirty business days to complete the termination of your
        Account, commencing on the business day that we have determined
        that you:

        a.  have paid in full all amounts or fees required under these
            Terms; and

        b.  are not subject to any actions, proceedings, investigations
            or disputes arising out of or in connection with your
            Account and your use of the Pace Services and Pace Platform.

    4.  Notwithstanding the termination of your Account (howsoever
        arising), (a) you remain liable for all outstanding payments
        (which shall include all instalments whether they are due or yet
        to be due, and any applicable late fees), dealings and
        transactions relating to your Account, the Pace Services and
        Pace Platform that you performed prior to the termination;
        and (b) we will continue to retain your personal information in
        accordance with our Privacy Policy and any applicable law, rule
        or regulation.

    5.  If a Customer Member's Account is suspended or terminated
        pursuant to Clause 8.1 above, without prejudice to any other
        rights we may have under this Agreement or at law, a Customer
        Member's liability for all instalments that are not then due and
        payable shall also become immediately due and payable upon
        receipt of our written demand which may be issued at our sole
        discretion.

    6.  Our purchase of the Right to Receive Payment from a Merchant
        Member shall be subject to our right to require a Merchant
        Member to immediately buyback from Pace the Right to Receive
        Payment from the Customer Member at the purchase price of the
        relevant Pace Buy transaction, *[less]{.underline}* any partial
        payments for the Pace Buy which we had received from the
        Customer Member, the Merchant Fee, and the Transaction Fee
        (**Limited Buyback Right**). Notwithstanding the foregoing, we
        shall only exercise the Limited Buyback Right if:

        a.  any warranties made by the Merchant Member under this
            Agreement is or proves to be incorrect or misleading when
            made;

        b.  there has been any breach of these Terms by the Merchant
            Member; or

        c.  there has been any fraud, illegality or unauthorized act
            (whether by a Merchant Member or Customer Member) in
            relation to any Pace Buy.

8.  **Chargebacks**

    1.  A Merchant Member and a Customer Member shall render their
        fullest cooperation to do all things we deem necessary for the
        investigation of any chargeback initiated by a Customer Member
        with the card issuer or card network against any of the Pace Buy
        instalments due to us (**Chargeback**). Without prejudice to the
        generality of the foregoing, a Merchant Member and Customer
        Member shall comply with the following process (**Chargeback
        Evaluation Process**):

        a.  We shall notify the Merchant Member and Customer Member as
            soon as reasonably practicable when we become aware of a
            Chargeback (**Chargeback Notification**). We shall also
            convey to the Merchant Member the reasons provided by the
            Customer Member, the card issuer and/or card network for the
            Chargeback.

        b.  The Merchant Member shall furnish to us sufficient evidence,
            in the form of any relevant supporting information and/or
            documents (**Supporting Evidence**), to enable the card
            issuer or card network to evaluate the veracity and
            legitimacy of the Chargeback within five days of the
            Chargeback Notification.

        c.  The Merchant Member may be required to provide additional
            Supporting Evidence if required by the card issuer or card
            network, and the Merchant Member shall comply with such
            request(s) within the timeline stipulated.

        d.  We shall notify the Merchant Member as soon as reasonably
            practicable upon receiving the determination by the card
            issuer or card network on the Customer Member's dispute on
            the Chargeback (**Chargeback Decision**). The Chargeback
            Decision shall be final and binding on the Merchant Member
            and Customer Member and shall not be subject to any appeal.

        e.  Notwithstanding any other terms to the contrary, failure to
            comply with any part of the Chargeback Evaluation Process
            may, in our sole discretion, render a Merchant Member liable
            to us for the amount corresponding to the Chargeback
            transaction.

    2.  A Merchant Member shall accept responsibility for a Chargeback
        Decision attributable to the Merchant Member's breach of the
        terms and conditions in connection with its sale of goods and
        services to a Customer Member, including for reasons due to (a)
        the failure to deliver goods and services, (b) provision of
        goods that are defective, damaged or fail to conform to the
        described specifications, and (c) provision of inadequate or
        defective service. Consequently, the Merchant Member shall be
        liable to us for the amount corresponding to the Chargeback
        transaction.

    3.  If a Merchant Member is determined or deemed to be responsible
        for a Chargeback pursuant to Clause 9, the Merchant Member shall
        also indemnify us for any fines, fees or assessment charges
        imposed by the payment processor, card network and/or card
        issuer.

    4.  A Customer Member shall accept responsibility for a Chargeback
        Decision that is determined against the Customer Member and
        remain liable to us for any outstanding instalments and late
        fees. A Customer Member shall also indemnify us for any fines,
        fees or assessment charges imposed by the payment processor,
        card network and/or card issuer.

9.  **Payments**

    1.  A Customer Member shall:

        a.  identify a Payment Method and provide true, accurate,
            current and complete information relating to the Payment
            Method as we may require from time to time, including the

            information;

        b.  expressly consent to, authorise and instruct us to initiate

            including the payment of all fees related to use and
            maintenance of the Payment Method, and interest or any other
            charges which may be imposed by the issuer of your debit or
            credit card.

    2.  A Merchant Member shall:

        a.  identify a Merchant Bank Account and provide true, accurate,
            current and complete information related to its Merchant
            Bank Account; and

        b.  comply with and be bound by all the terms of the card
            providers, payment processors and financial institutions
            providing or related to the Merchant Bank Account, including
            the payment of all fees related to use and maintenance of
            the Merchant Bank Account, interest or any other charges
            which may be imposed by the issuer of your debit or credit
            card.

    3.  Without prejudice to any other rights we have under this
        Agreement, we may at any time with prior notice, set off any
        amount due to Pace from any amount due from Pace to a Merchant
        Member or a Customer Member.

        negligence, breach of warranty, breach of statutory duty or
        under any other cause, for any loss, damage, cost or expenses of

        where liability is not excluded in the previous clauses, the
        maximum limit of Pace's liability to a Merchant Member or a
        Customer Member, whether in contract, tort, negligence, breach
        of warranty, breach of statutory duty or under any other cause,
        shall not exceed the value of the relevant Pace Buy transaction
        that is the subject matter of such claim.

    5.  Pace Services and the Pace Platform are provided as-is and

        any ownership of or other rights whatsoever to any Pace IP or
        Trademarks, except as expressly provided in these Terms.

    5.  We may collect, use, disclose or otherwise deal with any data

        provided by you, even if the telephone number is on a

        you have provided to us belongs to you and you are permitted to

        shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
        of Singapore.

    2.  These Terms are governed by Singapore laws, without regard to
        choice of law principles. The application of the United Nations
        Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
        expressly excluded.

17. **Miscellaneous**

    1.  These Terms are effective until your Account is terminated in
        accordance with these Terms. We may terminate these Terms
        immediately upon notice.

    2.  If the whole or a part of any provisions of these Terms is
        determined to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining
        provisions of these Terms that are not affected shall continue
        to be valid and binding upon the Parties and shall be
        enforceable.

    3.  These Terms constitute the entire agreement between the Parties
        with respect to their subject matters.

    4.  No failure or delay to exercise any right under these Terms will
        operate as a release or waiver of those rights. A single or
        partial exercise of any right does not prevent any other or
        further exercise of that right.

    5.  A person who is not subject to these Terms shall have no right
        under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act (Cap. 53B of
        Singapore) to enforce or enjoy the benefit of any terms under
        these Terms.

    6.  Nothing in these Terms shall be deemed to constitute or imply
        any partnership, joint venture, agency, fiduciary relationship
        or other relationship between the Parties other than the
        contractual relationship expressly provided for in these Terms.

    7.  A Party shall not have any liability under or be deemed to be in
        breach of these Terms for any delays or failures in performance
        of these Terms which result from circumstances beyond the
        reasonable control of that party, except for payment
        obligations. The Party affected by such circumstances shall
        promptly notify the other Party in writing when such
        circumstances cause a delay or failure in performance and when
        they cease to do so.

    8.  As at the date of publication of these Terms, we have been
        advised that we are likely to qualify for an exemption by the
        Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) from holding a Standard
        Payment Institution License for account issuance and merchant
        acquisition (MAS Licenses). Nevertheless, we have applied for
        the MAS Licenses in anticipation of our future growth.
