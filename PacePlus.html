  <ol class="number-list">
    <li>
      <p>These terms (<strong>Terms</strong>) govern the Pace Plus Order
        Form (<strong>Order Form</strong>) between a merchant
        (<strong>Merchant</strong>) and Pace (together the
        <strong>Parties</strong> and each a <strong>Party</strong>). Pace may
        amend these Terms from time to time without requiring the Merchant’s
        express or implied consent and without prior notice. All amendments to
        these Terms are effective upon publication on the Pace website,
        including at https://pacenow.co/terms-of-service/pace-plus. The
        Merchant’s continued use of Pace Plus after any amendments to these
        Terms is deemed as the Merchant’s agreement to these Terms, as
        amended.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The Terms of Service (<strong>TOS</strong>) as published on the
        Pace website shall be incorporated into these Terms and form part of

        the TOS and these Terms, these Terms shall prevail.</p>

      <p><strong>Pace Plus</strong></p>
      </br>
      <p>Under the Pace Plus programme, Pace shall be providing to the
        Merchant certain affiliate marketing services to promote and market
        certain promotional benefits to the Merchant’s new and existing
        customers to encourage their purchase of goods and/services from the
        Merchant via the Pace Platform (<strong>Pace Plus</strong>). The details
        of execution and deployment of the affiliate marketing services shall be
        mutually agreed between the Parties.</p>

      <p><strong>Referral Commission Fee</strong></p>
      <ol class="number-list">

            revised by Pace from time to time upon the provision of 30 days’ prior
            written notice to the Merchant.</p>

        <li>
          <p>If the Referral Commission Fee is calculated as a percentage of
            the purchase value of an applicable transaction generated by Pace Plus,
            the purchase value shall be amount of the customer’s purchase of goods
            and/or services excluding any discount applicable, including any
            discount from promotional vouchers or codes, shipping fees, and any
            other rebates.</p>

            the transactions generated by Pace Plus.</p>
