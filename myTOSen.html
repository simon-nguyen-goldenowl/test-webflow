A Customer Member shall make all instalment payments using the Payment Method.</p></li><li> <p>When a Customer Member makes a Pace Buy:</p><ol class="lower-alpha-bracket-list"> <li> <p>The Merchant Member shall first ensure that the Merchant Limit has not and will not exceed the Merchant Limit as a result of the Pace Buy to be transacted by the Customer Member.</p></li><li> <p>The Merchant Member, as the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Right to Receive Payment, agrees to irrevocably and unconditionally sell and assign the Right to Receive Payment to us immediately after the Pace Buy is concluded between the Merchant Member and the Customer Member and the Customer Member consents to such sale and assignment.</p></li><li> <p>For the avoidance of doubt, the Right to Receive Payment is assigned to us immediately after a Pace Buy is concluded. In exchange, we shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to pay the Merchant Member the price of the Pace Buy within two business days, less the Merchant Fee, Transaction Fee, and any amounts then owing by the Merchant Member to Pace under this Agreement (including any amounts arising from a Reversal transaction). Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, we reserve the right to defer the settlement date until such other time that the cumulative amounts to be settled to the Merchant Member exceed the sum of MYR100.</p></li><li> <p>We have the sole discretion to accept or reject the assignment to Right to Receive Payment without providing any reason. In case of the rejection of assignment, the Pace Platform shall reject such transaction and a Pace Buy will not be able to be completed. In the event of such rejection, the Merchant Member and the Customer Member shall make their own arrangement in relation to the completion of the sale and purchase of the goods. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not be a party to the transaction (in any capacity) once the Pace Platform has rejected such transaction. It is deemed that all assignments of the Right to Receive Payment are accepted by us if the underlying Pace Buy transaction is not rejected by the Pace Platform or was otherwise transacted in breach of this Agreement.</p></li><li> <p>The Merchant Member shall authorize Pace to send a notification on behalf of the Merchant Member to the Customer Member’s email address, as provided in the Customer Member’s Registration Data. This notification shall serve as a notice by the Merchant Member to notify the Customer Member that the Right to Receive Payment is assigned to us and shall also contain instructions to the Customer Member regarding the method of payment to us.</p></li><li> <p>The Customer Member pays us, as the sole legal and beneficial owner of the Right to Receive Payment in place of the Merchant Member, the price of the Pace Buy in three monthly instalments. The first instalment is due and payable upon the Pace Buy.</p></li><li> <p>Except as provided in this clause, the rights and obligations of the Customer Member and the Merchant Member in relation to the sale and purchase under the Pace Buy remain unchanged.</p></li></ol> </li><li> <p>A Merchant Member pays the Merchant Fee and Transaction Fee for the use of Pace Services.</p></li><li> <p>We reserve the right to impose a late fee on any amounts owing by a Merchant Member to us at the rate of 2.5% per month on the outstanding amount which shall accrue until such outstanding amounts are paid in full.</p></li><li> <p>A Customer Member is not required to pay us any fees for the use of Pace Services. A Merchant Member shall not charge a Customer Member any separate fees, costs, or charges on for Pace Buys for any purposes whatsoever.</p></li><li> <p>Generally, a Customer Member is not permitted to make Pace Buys in excess of the Pace Buy Limit. The Pace Buy Limit is reduced by the total amount of a Customer Member's unpaid instalments. However, we may in our sole discretion permit a Customer Member to make Pace Buys in excess of the Pace Buy Limit provided that the amount paid by the Customer Member for the first instalment at the point of purchase is increased to the extent necessary to ensure that the remaining instalments payable is within the Pace Buy Limit. For the avoidance of doubt, unless excepted as provided in the foregoing sentence, we will not be a party to the transaction (in any capacity) in the event that the Customer Member has exceeded the Pace Buy Limit.</p></li><li> <p>Pace Services are not loans, financing or credit facilities of any kind whatsoever. We do not provide insurance of any kind. We are solely a technology service provider.</p></li><li> <p>Each Merchant Member is solely and fully liable for the sale and supply of goods and services under a Pace Buy. We are not a party to the sale and purchase contracts under Pace Buys. We do not own, create, manufacture, sell, resell, provide, control, manage, offer, deliver or supply any Merchant Member goods or service. We expressly disclaim all warranties related to the Merchant Member goods and services, express, implied or howsoever arising, including any warranties of accuracy, reliability, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.</p></li><blockquote> <p><u>Early Payment by Customer Member</u></p></blockquote> <li> <p>A Customer Member can make an early payment of any instalment(s) owing to us, whether partially or in full, at any time before the due date of the relevant instalment(s) (<strong>Early Payment</strong>). No fees or charges are imposed on a Customer Member for making an Early Payment.</p></li><li> <p>A Customer Member will need to manually input in the Pace Platform the amount of Early Payment that is desired to be made for the relevant Pace Buy transaction. We will apply the entire Early Payment amount made against the upcoming instalment which will become due (and late fees payable, if any) and if there is any surplus payment in excess of the upcoming instalment amount due, such surplus amount will be applied against the following instalment that is yet to be due.</p></li><blockquote> <p><u>Late Fee</u></p></blockquote> <li> <p>A Customer Member shall pay all instalments promptly before the due date. We do not impose interest if you fail to pay any instalments on time. However, if payment is not received within two days from the due date of each instalment, a one-time late fee of MYR10 will be levied on each late payment. Subject to Clause 1.3 above, we reserve the right to alter the late fees in our sole discretion.</p></li><blockquote> <p><u>Reversal Transaction</u></p></blockquote> <li> <p>Each Merchant Member is solely and fully liable for handling disputes, refunds, returns and all other aspects of the sale and supply of goods and services in connection with a Pace Buy. For the avoidance of doubt, we will not be responsible to any Customer Members for any defects or failure in delivery of the goods and services by the Merchant Member. We will refer all Customer Members to the relevant Merchant Member for these purposes.</p></li><li> <p>In the event that we receive a Reversal Instruction from a Merchant Member in respect of any order by a Customer Member, we shall process the Reversal transaction, as follows:</p><ol class="lower-alpha-bracket-list"> <li> <p>Within two business days of sending to Pace a Reversal Instruction, a Merchant Member shall refund Pace by paying to us the relevant amount and such refund shall be effected by our deduction from the running balance to be settled with the Merchant Member. In the event that the running balance is insufficient, the Merchant Member shall refund to us the relevant amount by paying the relevant amount by telegraphic bank transfer to Pace’s nominated bank account;</p></li><li> <p>We reserve the right to retain the applicable Merchant Fee and Transaction Fee in respect of the relevant Pace Buy in the event of any Reversal transaction. In addition, if the Customer Member had failed to pay the relevant instalment by the due date, we also reserve the right to deduct the applicable late fees from the refund due to the Customer Member;</p></li><li> <p>Following our receipt of the Reversal Instruction from the Merchant Member, we shall activate the refund to a Customer Member as soon as reasonably possible. A Customer Member’s refund shall be effected in the following order:</p><ol class="lower-roman-bracket-list"> <li> <p>We shall first set off the amount to be refunded against the value of all instalments that have yet to fall due for payment; and</p></li><li> <p>Thereafter, if there remains any balance amount to be refunded, the sum shall be refunded to the Payment Method, subject to any terms and policies which may be imposed by the debit or credit card providers, payment processors and financial institutions providing or related to the Payment Method. Depending on the policies instituted by the Customer Member’s debit or credit card providers, the Customer Member can expect to receive the refund within around seven to fourteen business days from the time that Pace activates the refund; and</p></li></ol> </li><li> <p>In the event that a Merchant Member fails to comply with its obligation under this Clause 3.12 or Pace is unable to deduct the amounts arising from a Reversal transaction from the amounts payable by Pace to a Merchant Member, we reserve the right to set off all such amounts owing from any other payments to be made to a Merchant Member with respect to further Pace Buys.</p></li></ol> </li><li> <p>In the event a Customer Member notifies us, or we become aware of the occurrence of a Service Failure:</p><ol class="lower-alpha-bracket-list"> <li> <p>If payment of the price of the Pace Buy relating to the Service Failure has not been made to the Merchant Member, we reserve the right to withhold the price of the Pace Buy relating to the Service Failure from any payments owing to the Merchant Member under this agreement. If the Merchant Member provides to us within 7 days upon our written request for the same, sufficient evidence, in the form of any relevant supporting information and/or documents, to our reasonable satisfaction that the claim of the Service Failure was not genuine or made in good faith, we shall release to the Merchant Member the payment withheld less amounts then owing by the Merchant Member to Pace under this Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable, failing which we shall not be obligated to make any payment to the Merchant Member in respect of the Pace Buy relating to the Service Failure.</p></li><li> <p>If payment of the price of the Pace Buy relating to the Service Failure has been made to the Merchant Member, we reserve the right to deduct the relevant amount from any other payments to be made to a Merchant Member with respect to further Pace Buys unless the Merchant Member provides to us within 7 days upon our written request for the same, any documents, invoices, records or other evidence to our reasonable satisfaction that the claim of the Service Failure was not genuine or made in good faith.</p></li><li> <p>If we determine that a Customer Member shall be refunded, any such refund shall be effected in accordance with Clause 3.13.</p></li><blockquote> <p><u>Merchant Limit</u></p></blockquote> <li> <p>A Merchant Member shall be subject to the Merchant Limit which shall be determined by us from time to time in our sole discretion. For clarity, we reserve the right to modify a Merchant Member’s Merchant Limit at any time by written notification, and the revised Merchant Limit shall take effect immediately upon service of such notice.</p></li><li> <p>We reserve the right (but not the obligation) to suspend any further Pace Buys from being transacted through the Merchant Member’s Account if the Merchant Limit is or will be exceeded.</p></li><blockquote> <p><u>Tax</u></p></blockquote> <li> <p>If the sale and purchase of the Right to Receive Payment is subject to any sales and services tax (<strong>SST</strong>) which may be imposed on the Merchant Fee or Transaction Fee under law, the Merchant Member agrees that the Merchant Fee and Transaction Fee shall be subject to the imposition of SST.</p></li></ol> </li></ol> </li><li> <p><strong>Eligibility Warranties</strong></p><ol class="number-list"> <li> <p>If a Customer Member, you warrant that you:</p><ol class="lower-alpha-bracket-list"> <li> <p>are a natural person who is 18 years or older;</p></li><li> <p>are capable of entering legally binding contracts;</p></li><li> <p>are not a bankrupt or the subject of any bankruptcy proceedings;</p></li><li> <p>have a valid and verifiable email address and mobile telephone number;</p></li><li> <p>are the authorised user of the Payment Method;</p></li><li> <p>have created an Account by truthfully providing all Registration Data;</p></li><li> <p>before making a Pace Buy transaction, you have read or are made expressly aware of all terms and conditions relating to your purchase of the goods and/or services from the Merchant, including the Merchant’s cancellation and refund policies (if any), the total purchase price and all other relevant information;</p></li><li> <p>do not conduct any Prohibited Transactions;
