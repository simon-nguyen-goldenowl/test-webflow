                            The Pace Buy Limit is reduced by the total amount of a Customer Member's unpaid instalments.
                            However, we may in our sole discretion permit a Customer Member to make Pace Buys in excess
                            of
                            the Pace Buy Limit provided that the amount paid by the Customer Member for the first
                            instalment
                            at the point of purchase is increased to the extent necessary to ensure that the remaining
                            instalments payable is within the Pace Buy Limit, and the Payment Method selected for that
                            purchase is through a credit card or debit card. For the avoidance of doubt, unless excepted
